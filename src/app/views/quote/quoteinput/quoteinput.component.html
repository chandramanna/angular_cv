						<h2>Car Insurance Overview</h2>
						<p>Car Insurance, alternatively known as motor insurance or auto insurance is a specific policy that you buy
							for the protection of your vehicle against any sort of damages due to inescapable or unfortunate accident.
							Since India is a country mainly known for its vast population, car accidents have become a daily drama
							here. No matter how safely you drive your car or how responsibly you manage your vehicle, accidents can
							happen just as fast as we blink isn’t it? Imagine this: you parked your car outside a shopping mall and
							when you come back from shopping after a couple hours, with a bolt from the blue you discover a big dent
							on the back of your car. How do you deal with such situation? Well, fortunately, that’s when your online
							car insurance policy comes into its role play.</p>

								Cubic capacity of the vehicles is the prime feature to calculate online car insurance quotes. Similar to
								age, the cars with higher cubic capacity also attract higher car insurance quotes online. There are
								three slabs such as less than 1000 cc, between 1000 cc and 1500 cc and more than 1500 cc to assess
								online car insurance quotes according to cubic capacity.
							</li>


							<li>IDV of the car helps to figure out the quote. As the Insured Declared Value (IDV) increases, online
								motor insurance quotes get elevated as well. If you make car insurance quotes comparison of two cars
								with same IDV or Insured Declared value, car insurance quotes online will differ on the basis of other
								factors</li>
							<li>Vehicle registration location also helps to assess online car insurance quote. It plays an
								instrumental role in working out online car insurance quotes. There are two zones in terms of car
								insurance quotes. Zone A consists of 8 major cities in India where auto insurance quotes are higher. The
								rest of India comes under zone B and car insurance quotes are lower in zone B. If you make car insurance
								quote comparison in terms of these two zones, cars registered in zone A will attract higher online car
								insurance quotes because the risk of accident and theft is higher in zone A.
								Your four wheeler type also influences car insurance quotes online</li>
							<li>Type of the fuel of car determines online motor insurance quotes</li>
							<li>Apart from these, if you make online car insurance quotes comparison of two vehicles of the same age,
								car insurance quotes online will vary in terms of cubic capacity and location.
							</li>
